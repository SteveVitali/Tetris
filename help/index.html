                <p><strong>High Scores</strong>
                    When the game is over, we show very granular game
                    statistics, like minos locked per minute, or number
                    of double tetrises.
                </p>
                <p><strong>High Scores</strong>
                    The game sends scores to and fetches scores from a
                    node application with a MongoDB backend.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Auto-Pause</strong>
                    When the application frame loses focus, the game will
                    automatically pause. And, when you refocus, it will
                    automatically unpause.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Ghost Mino</strong>
                    Some Tetris games leave out the ghost mino. I think
                    Tetris is unplayable without a ghost mino, so we have
                    included a ghost mino.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Hold Queue</strong>
                    This is another one of those minor things that some Tetris
                    implementations don't include (I'm looking at you, Quinn)
                    that that is really necessary for a good Tetris experience.
                    You can store minos in and retrieve minos from the hold
                    queue (using the 'C' key). This is useful for discarding
                    of bad minos, or saving up I-minos to get double tetrises.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Lock delay</strong>
                    We have a generous 0.9-second lock delay that resets on
                    every horizontal translation or rotation, so your minos
                    won't get locked into the matrix prematurely.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Wall-kicks</strong>
                    We allow mino shifts of up to 3 blocks (up or left/right,
                    or some combination). Implementations that won't let you
                    (for example) rotate an I-mino against the wall (again,
                    I'm looking at you, Quinn) are annoying, so we let you
                    do that.
