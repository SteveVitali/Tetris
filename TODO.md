TODO:
- Add toggle for dark vs. light mode; also sound toggle
- Comment code so I don't lose style points
- Add labels for "Hold", "Time", "Lines", "Next" panels
- Count-down timer when game starts
- Add a home screen that makes sense
- Allow user to move sideways and rotate simultaneously
- Refactor the Action enum into a bunch of objects to factor out switch cases
